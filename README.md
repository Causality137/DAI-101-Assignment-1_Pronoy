# Heart Attack Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes heart attack risk factors using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques. The dataset includes variables such as `Heart_Attack_Risk`, `Heart_Attack_History`, and `Family_History`. Key tasks include handling missing values, detecting outliers, removing them, correlation analysis, and visualization using contour and KDE plots.

## Features

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removing redundant and unnecessary columns
- Handling missing values using NaN replacement.
- Removing outliers using Z-score threshold.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histogram and KDE plots for univariate analysis.
- Skewness calculation and Box plots for outlier detection.
- Correlation matrices and heatmaps for bivariate/multivariate relationships.

### Visualization
- 2D and 3D contour plots for density estimation.
- Pair plots and KDE plots for variable distributions.
- Heatmaps for multivariate correlations.
